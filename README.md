the first screen i would need is the start screen
- have an option for human guesser, computer guesser, and quit options
- if its 1 i would activate HumanGuesser()
- 2 activates ComputerGuesser()
- 3 would just exit
for the Human GUesser
- the computer will chose a random number 1-100
- the computer would ask the human to guess a number, depending on the number the computer would say
-   too low
-   too high
-   got the number
for the computer guesser
- ask the human for a number 1-100
- set values for lower or higher
- for the loop it should start by the computer guessing 50
- ask the human if the guess is too high or too low

the exit button would just quit the game
